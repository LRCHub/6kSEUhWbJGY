How can all that I am be fit inside of a sheet of white A4?
A smile and I'm hoping they come to accept me
With a welcome aboard
Twisting through, now I'm lost without a clue
In a maze of ups and downs
Said try until it's over and won
But I found there maybe no way out

But everyone is way ahead
I'm being left behind again
A world beyond a track
I yearn to move past
When can I have that?
But tell me

What do I want?
Who do I wanna be?
And what am I good at?
Can I do anything?
See how I made it so damn far?
I did it crawling on my knees
What about tomorrow?
I don't know what it brings
What about the future?
It won't change anything
Then let me have this one day only for me

Wish you well were the words they'd always tell me
A life cut bit by bit
And handing out the pieces to anyone now
But told I just don't fit

They said I couldn't do a thing
And honestly I might agree
I'm worn in every way and crawling through days
Will I look the same?
Or maybe

Was it really worth it?
Was it my dream?
And what did I lose in the flow of everything?
Searching for the answer, I came this far
And did it grinding down my teeth
End it all tomorrow, the world and me too
Maybe I'll forget it, the day before soon
So let me have this one day only for me

But everyone is way ahead
I'm being left behind again
So tell me where did I go wrong?
What was I doing all along?
They said I couldn't do a thing
And honestly I might agree
I'm worn in nearly every way
But breathing and alive today

Telling me
What do I want?
Who do I wanna be?
And what am I good at?
Can I do anything?
See how I made it so damn far?
I did it crawling on my knees
What about tomorrow?
I don't what it brings
What about the future?
It won't change anything
Then let me have this one
This moment, only one
Belongs to you and me
